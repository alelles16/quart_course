# Quart provides a mechanism for storing global variables
# that are unique to a particular request context.

# That is used for request andÂ session,
# but is also available to store any custom object.


# The quart.g variable contains all globals,
# and you can set whatever attributes you want on it. In Quart,
# the @app.before_request decorator can be used to
# point to a function that the app will call every time a request is made,
# just before it dispatches the request to a view.

def authenticate():
    if request.authorization:

    else:

@app.before_request
def greetings():
    g.say_hello = "Say hello!"


@app.route("/api")
